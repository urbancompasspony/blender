MODIFY

* Data Transfer - Project normals from an object direct on another.
* Mesh Cache - Creates a cache for animation that can be saved as .mdd and imported before. (requires extra add-on "mdd import export" to handle .mdd files)
* Normal Edit - Most used for set lots os mesh trees facing the camera; set normals of an object based on another one.
* Weighted - Ties normals of objects making them with smooth edges when using something like subdivision modifier and the faces or vertices become irregular.
* UV Project - Select an object as projector for UV Maps, so even if object is rotating, the projection keeps on same side of origin.
* UV Warp - Allows to use external objects like "empty axis" and use it to alter the UV projection of another object.
* Vertex Weight Edit - Select vertex group to edit, so you can do some things like change painting job for vertex and create height on meshs.
* Vertex Group Mix - Like the Vertex Weight but working as Mix to multiple Vertex Groups.
* Vertex Weight Proximity - Set an mesh as "sensor" to create some kind of effects on Vertex Groups.

GENERATE

* Array - Replicate a mesh, creating paterns based on coordinates like rotate, scale and etc.
* Bevel - Creates bevels, a kind of sub-surface on all Edges of a mesh, that can be curved ones or regular ones.
* Boolean - Can be used to cut objects using other objects as reference and setting special parameters for this.
* Build - Create a cool effect of a mesh being "build" face by face through timeline.
* Decimate - Let you to remove excessive edges of a mesh and is something like the reverse of subdivision modify, turning a complex mesh into a low poly one.
* Edge Split - Separate a face from another face based on edges. A cube can be 6 single plane meshs.
* Mask - Hides objects based on vertex groups or armature.
* Mirror - Will mirror objects replicating a side, face, form, etc indo equal one but in mirror shaped format.
* Multiresolution - Is like a subdivision modifier but with more complex effects and options to subdivide edges of meshs.
* Remesh - Changes the topology of a mesh to something like sharp, smooth or even block option, the last one looks like voxel style.
* Screw - Creates a screw from a mesh. You can set angle and how often will be repeated, something like mirror and array together.
* Skin - Creates a sort of chats around the edges of a mesh, like using a box you can create a low poly tree.
* Solidify - Creates a Z axis based on face of a mesh, if using on a plane, it gain thickness. If using on a cube, it will have thick faces.
* Subdivision - Subdivide surface of a mesh, creating smooth models. Can be set to just viewport or on rendering.
* Triangulate - Let you turn in triangles a mesh that is based on squared/polygon faces.
* Wireframe - Automatically creates a wireframe of a mesh.
* Weld - Merge faces of meshs based on distance, to keep together faces that are close enough.

Deform Modifiers

* Armature - It add a rig to a model to animate it.
* Cast - Can turn things on spheres, cylinders or cuboids.
* Curve - Set an object along a curve, you can even set an array along a curve!
* Displace - Uses a texture as coordinate to create a deformating of your mesh up and down, ideal for create a 3D form of a 2D image.
* Hook - Uses an object like an empty to edit the geometry of another object.
* Laplacian Deform - Using hooks on vertex groups you can deform a mesh, like turning a horse into a giraffe.
* Lattice - Create a empty object around your main object and deform it based on this empty object. Ideal for high density models with lots of objects together.
* Mesh Deform - Like the lattice, but using a mesh instead.
* Shrinkwrap - It merges an object, like a plane, into another one. Is some sort of re-topology modifier.
* Simple Deform - Twist or even bend objects in simple ways.
* Smooth - Can deform an object based on the model itself, careful because when doing this on Suzanne you can create something out of nightmares.
* Smooth Corrective - Fix mistakes on object Armature
* Laplacian Smooth - Works on faces of a mesh, creating smoothier holes for example.
* Surface Deform - Let you deform something based on another object, all the mesh, ideal for add wind effect on complex curtains for example.
* Warp - Proportional deform based on starting point and ending point, like 2 empty objects deforming a plane until it becomes a sphere.
* Wave - Creates a wave animation through a mesh.

Simulate

* Cloth - More used from Physics Tab: creates a simulation of cloth on a mesh.
* Collision - More used from Physics Tab: creates a mesh that will be solid for a cloth for example.
* Dynamic Paint - More used from Physics Tab: Creates a deformation on mesh based on another object as reference. Needs a brush and a canvas.
* Fluid Simulation - More used from Physics Tab: Creates a fluid simulation based on mantaflow. Needs 2 objects: a DOMAIN and a FLUID.
* Soft Body - More used from Physics Tab: Used to create jelly effect on objects.
* Explosion - Divide an object and it will break, ideal to do something that is broken and falling apart.
* Ocean - Creates a deformation that will looks like waves of ocean. Ideal for bigger planes but can be adjusted to small ones.
* Particle Instance - Allow you to copy a particle system of an object and use it on another one.
* Particle System - Creates a particle emitter for simple particles or "hair".
