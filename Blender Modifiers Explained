MODIFY

* Data Transfer - Project normals from an object direct on another.
* Mesh Cache - Creates a cache for animation that can be saved as .mdd and imported before. (requires extra add-on "mdd import export" to handle .mdd files)
* Normal Edit - Most used for set lots os mesh trees facing the camera; set normals of an object based on another one.
* Weighted - Ties normals of objects making them with smooth edges when using something like subdivision modifier and the faces or vertices become irregular.
* UV Project - Select an object as projector for UV Maps, so even if object is rotating, the projection keeps on same side of origin.
* UV Warp - Allows to use external objects like "empty axis" and use it to alter the UV projection of another object.
* Vertex Weight Edit - Select vertex group to edit, so you can do some things like change painting job for vertex and create height on meshs.
* Vertex Group Mix - Like the Vertex Weight but working as Mix to multiple Vertex.
* Vertex Weight Proximity -
