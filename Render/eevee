For Both Blender and UPBGE:

- Scene Properties: Units / Metric

- Use less complex procedural textures
- Ambient Occlusion: Distance 0.150 / Factor 1.00 / Trace 0.010
- Bloom: Threshold 3.0 / Knee 0.5 / Radius 6.5 / Color White / Intensity 0.2 / Clamp 0
- Depth of Field: Max 10 / Sprite 1 / Neighborhood 1.0 / Denoise 0.75 / HighQS. and Jitter not checked
- Subsurface Scatering: Samples 2 / Jitter 0.3
- Screen Space Reflections (ray tracing): Refraction not checked / Half RT. Checked / Trace 0.010 / Max 0.3 / Edge 0.5 / Clamp 0
- Volumetrics: Tile 2
- Shadows: Cube 128 / Cascade 128 / SoftShadows checked / Light T. 0.02 (lower is brighter)
- Indirect Lighting: Diffuse 3 / Cube 128px / D.O. 32 px
- Color Management: Filmic / Medium High Contrast

On Blender:

- Exporting Image Format: OpenEXR (not Multilayer!)
- Use Persistent Data to optimize.
- Sampling: Render 30 / View 16 (more is better but slower)

On UPBGE:

- A nice tab organization: Layout | LogicNodes | LogicBricks | TimeLine | NLA | Shading | Scripting | UV Editing | GameTest
- Camera for FPS Game: Perspective 90 / Field of View / Clip End 2.000 / Camera Auto 32 mm / LOD 0.1
- Use point instead of Spot for Lights (consume less resource)
- Under Scene Settings, tunr on Culling (hide what is not being seen)
- Sampling: SMAA not shecked
