TIPS AND TRICKS:

Resolvendo LightBleed:
- Solidify Object
- Angle or Radius of Light

Create Lightprobe Volume to better results with lights!

Light Probe> PLANE
Resize to get all object area!
Click VIEWPORT Display Capture to see it in live.
Anoying: It spawns bellow necessary, so click and move it slightly up, around 0.1 or 0.2
And a Spherical Probe around object that needs to reflect everything around, like eyes!
