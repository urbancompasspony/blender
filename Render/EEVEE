Anoying: It spawns bellow necessary, so click and move it slightly up, around 0.1 or 0.2

And a Spherical Probe around object that needs to reflect everything around, like eyes!

Ray Tracing Resolution:
1:1 = 100%
1:2 = 50%

Fast GI Aproximation: Set steps from 8 to 16
Distance to 0 = infinite
Set to something around the object to limit hardware use.
