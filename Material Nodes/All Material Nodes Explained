Input Nodes

* Ambient Occlusion - Sets AO
* Attribute - Create a specific attribute of Color or Vector based on Name
* Camera Data - Set configuration for Camera
* Fresnel - An algorithm that determines where light should be reflected or refracted; used for mixing two materials
* Geometry - Can set parameters of geometry of an object, changing how it is rendered through shaders
* Hair Info - Set details about Hair from Particles Modifier
* Layer Weight - Work similar to fresnel node but has more options
* Light Path - Changes how light is passing by a material, making even glowy ones!
* Object Info - Catch information to avoid repetition
* Particle Info - Catch information to avoid repetition
* RGB - Returns a pre defined color
* Tangent - More used with custom Anisotropic BSDF node
* Texture Coordinate - Set where a texture should be. You can use Eyedrop to select another object to copy parameters as reference to generate texture.
* UV Map - To catch just one UV Map, ideal when you have lot's of UV Maps on the same object.
* Vallue - Generates a pre determined value
* Wireframe - Apply wireframe effect to a material
* Material Output - The End of all nodes setup.

Shader Nodes

* Add Shader - Will just add a shader data on top of another shader
* Anisotropic BSDF - Adjust the effect seen on bottom of a kitchen pan! Bends the light around a point.
* Diffuse BSDF - The old default node for materials.
* Emission - Turns any surface as a emission surface.
* Glass BSDF - Turns any surface as a glass.
* Hair BSDF - To hair simulations. Replaced by Principled Hair BSDF
* Principled BSDF - The Default node for any material.
* Holdout - Turns an object into a mask alpha, something invisible.
* Mix Shader - Is used to mix shaders with adjustable proportion
* Principled Hair BSDF - The default hair simulation inside Particle System
* Refraction BSDF - Ajust refractions of the material
* Subsurface Scatering - Useful for things like wax, skin or marbles.
* Toon BSDF - Used to create a cartoon style material. THIS IS NOT used for cell shading effect!
* Translucent BSDF - Increases the capacity to see through the objects
* Transparent BSDF - Set capacity to see through the objects entirely
* Velvet BSDF - Used for fabric based reflections
* Volume Scatter - Set how light scatter through volumes, like on Subsurface Scatering
* Volume Absorption - Set how light absorves light through volumes

Texture Nodes

* Brick Texture - Creates bricks paterns
* Checker Texture - To create a Chess pattern
* Environment Texture - Puts a texture in the skybox of the scenery, on World Output, not an object!
* Gradient Texture - Creates a pre determined gradient based on two inputs
* IES Texture - Special textures with special files
* Image Texture - Just set's an image as a texture. Useful to set easy UV Maps. You can use Videos too.
* Magic Texture - It's just magic!
* Musgrave Texture - Used to create random patterns for nature textures
* Noise Texture - Creates noise to be applyed over meshs, creating patterns.
* Sky Texture - Used to set sky on World Output.
* Voronoi Texture - Creates a specific pattern of randomness but same time not so random
* Wave Texture - Creates wave patterns
* White Noise Texture - Another kind of noise, seen on blank TV Channel or something

Color Nodes

* Brightness/Contrast - Sets brightness and contrast of textures
* Gamma -Adjusts Brightness on another way
* Hue Saturation Value - Set how strong or weak is the colors of a material
* Invert - Inverts color or black to white and vice-versa
* Mix RGB - Mix 2 colors or textures
* Overlay - Set how a color or texture will be applyed over another color or texture
* Light Falloff - Normally used on lamps to create paterns
* RGB Curves - Used for color correction

Vector Nodes

* Bump - Will create a normal output based on height map input, creating a fake geometry based on shaders.
* Vector Curves - Like RGB Curves is used for vector corrections, used not so often.
* Displacement - Will get a heigh map and displace over the objects faces, creating real geometry based on mesh.
* Mapping - Control position, rotation and scale of texture on a model

Converter Nodes

* What its name says, convert a thing to another

* Blackbody - Used to convert temperature reading on color, for example.
* Clamp -
