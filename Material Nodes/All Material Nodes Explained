Input Nodes

* Ambient Occlusion - Sets AO
* Attribute - Create a specific attribute of Color or Vector based on Name
* Camera Data - Set configuration for Camera
* Fresnel - An algorithm that determines where light should be reflected or refracted; used for mixing two materials
* Geometry - Can set parameters of geometry of an object, changing how it is rendered through shaders
* Hair Info - Set details about Hair from Particles Modifier
* Layer Weight - Work similar to fresnel node but has more options
* Light Path - Changes how light is passing by a material, making even glowy ones!
* Object Info - Catch information to avoid repetition
* Particle Info - Catch information to avoid repetition
* RGB - Returns a pre defined color
* Tangent - More used with custom Anisotropic BSDF node
* Texture Coordinate - Set where a texture should be. You can use Eyedrop to select another object to copy parameters as reference to generate texture.
* UV Map - To catch just one UV Map, ideal when you have lot's of UV Maps on the same object.
* Vallue - Generates a pre determined value
* Wireframe - Apply wireframe effect to a material
* Material Output - The End of all nodes setup.
