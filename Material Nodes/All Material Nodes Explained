Input Nodes

* Ambient Occlusion - Sets AO
* Attribute - Create a specific attribute of Color or Vector based on Name
* Camera Data - Set configuration for Camera
* Fresnel - An algorithm that determines where light should be reflected or refracted; used for mixing two materials
* Geometry - Can set parameters of geometry of an object, changing how it is rendered through shaders
* Hair Info - Set details about Hair from Particles Modifier
* Layer Weight - Work similar to fresnel node but has more options
* Light Path - Changes how light is passing by a material, making even glowy ones!
* Object Info - Catch information to avoid repetition
* Particle Info - Catch information to avoid repetition
* RGB - Returns a pre defined color
* Tangent - More used with custom Anisotropic BSDF node
* Texture Coordinate - Set where a texture should be. You can use Eyedrop to select another object to copy parameters as reference to generate texture.
* UV Map - To catch just one UV Map, ideal when you have lot's of UV Maps on the same object.
* Vallue - Generates a pre determined value
* Wireframe - Apply wireframe effect to a material
* Material Output - The End of all nodes setup.

Shader Nodes

* Add Shader - Will just add a shader data on top of another shader
* Anisotropic BSDF - Adjust the effect seen on bottom of a kitchen pan! Bends the light around a point.
* Diffuse BSDF - The old default node for materials.
* Emission - Turns any surface as a emission surface.
* Glass BSDF - Turns any surface as a glass.
* Hair BSDF - To hair simulations. Replaced by Principled Hair BSDF
* Principled BSDF - The Default node for any material.
* Holdout - Turns an object into a mask alpha, something invisible.
* Mix Shader - Is used to mix shaders with adjustable proportion
* Principled Hair BSDF - The default hair simulation inside Particle System
* Refraction BSDF - Ajust refractions of the material
* Subsurface Scatering - Useful for things like wax, skin or marbles.
* Toon BSDF - Used to create a cartoon style material. THIS IS NOT used for cell shading effect!
* Translucent BSDF - Increases the capacity to see through the objects
* Transparent BSDF - Set capacity to see through the objects entirely
* Velvet BSDF - Used for fabric based reflections
* Volume Scatter - Set how light scatter through volumes, like on Subsurface Scatering
* Volume Absorption - Set how light absorves light through volumes
