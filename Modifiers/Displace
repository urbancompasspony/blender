Thanks to Guilherme Bretas for the tip!

Create a new object.
Subdivide surface around 50.
Create a new modifier, Displace, click New.
Texture, click "show texture on texture tab", click NEW or Open an Existing one.
For better results use something black and white.
Back to modifier, change coordinates do UV and adjust Strenght.
