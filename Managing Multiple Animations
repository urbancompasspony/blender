You will need 3 panels:

TimeLine
Dope Sheet, changing mode to Action
Nonlinear Animation (NLA)

Use DopeSheet to create a New timeline.
Use TimeLine to set keyframes of your new animation/pose/object/whatever
Use NLA to create a new instance of that animation, isolating it to be used when you needed.

If not working over LogicBricks or LogicNodes, redo everything, even the timeline on NLA.
