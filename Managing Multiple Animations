You will need 2 panels:

1) TimeLine, changing EDITOR TYPE to Dope Sheet!
Under Dope Sheet, change Editing Context to Action!
2) Nonlinear Animation (NLA)


Use DopeSheet to create a New timeline.
Use TimeLine to set keyframes of your new animation/pose/object/whatever
Use NLA to create a new instance of that animation, isolating it to be used when you needed!
The NLA is the secret to have multiple animations running on separate timelines

If not working over LogicBricks or LogicNodes, redo everything, even the timeline on NLA.
