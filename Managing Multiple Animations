You will need 2 workspaces, one of them with 2 panels.
The first one, with 2 panels:

1) Editor Type: Timeline

2) Editor Type: Dope Sheet!
Editing Context: Action!

The second workspace:
Nonlinear Animation (NLA)

Use DopeSheet to create a New timeline.
Use TimeLine to set keyframes of your new animation/pose/object/whatever
Use NLA to create a new instance of that animation, isolating it to be used when you needed!
The NLA is the secret to have multiple animations running on separate timelines

On NLA, edit timeline and set ACTIVE STRIP to:
Extrapolation: Nothing
Blending: Combine

If not working over LogicBricks or LogicNodes, redo everything, even the timeline on NLA.
