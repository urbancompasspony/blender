To Solid:
Physics Tab > Fluid
Type Effector
Collision

To Liquid:
Physics Tab > Fluid
Type: Flow / Liquid
Settings: Inflow

To Domain (a box around Solid and Liquid):
Physics Tab > Fluid
Type: Domain / Liquid
Resolution: Not more than 64 or will be laggy
TimeScale: 1.0 or More (more is faster, more fluid like water)

Check viscosity if you want something like honey
Check MESH

# To Stop Fluid Animation, like a water flow stopping, but animation continues.

On Flow Object (normally a sphere) click on it and look for [x]FLOW on menu, set keyframe there!
Boolean only.

GOLD RULE:
It's important that Voxel Size of Domain is smaller than the Inflow (Sphere) Object!
So either make the Inflow Object bigger; or increase the Resolution Divisions (32 by default to something like 250)

Tweaks:
In the Physic Properties settings of the Liquid Domain is an option called Fluid > [X] Liquid > [X] Fractional Obstacles.
When it's enabled obstacles will create much more splashes.
