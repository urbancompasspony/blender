Resolution: Set it to 640x480
VHS are low res!

Create 4 filters, 2 are Soften set to 1.0 and 2 are Sharpen set to 0.5.
From first soften goes to first sharpen, then goes to second soften and finally second sharpen.
It will "break" the image.

Create a "Separate Color Node (RGB)", create a new "Soften filter node", a "Sharpen filter node", a "Transform node" and a "Combine Color node (RGB)".
Filters Soften again set to 1.0, Sharpen to 0.5 and Transform set: Nearest, image X 1.0, Y 0.0, angle 0 and scale 1.000
Link "Separate Color Node" RED to Soften, Green to Transform and Blue to Sharpen. The result goes to Combine Color.
It will separate colors like the VHS does.

For an effect like "overlay of date and time", create a MIX node, change it to Screen.
Input of it is another node, a Scale, set to Render Size and tick Stretch.
And another node, an Image with Alpha channel (.png!) and use ALPHA exit of node, not "image".
