- Choose and download something from Mixamo, model and animation!
Set IN PLACE if there is some animation like this, create movement inside UPBGE.
Export as FBX., with Skin, Frames (30 or 60).

- For every .FBX downloaded, create a new UPBGE File, clear scene, import fbx, rename animation on DopeSheet Action and save as .blend.
Check from where frame is start and end of animation, will be important later.

- Import every animation on your main.blend with File, Append... and choose just Action from file animation.blend created previously

- Using Logic Nodes you can play animation with a condition (keyboard) and "play animation".
Output "Running" will be "Apply Movement node", something around X 0.03 for walking and 0.13 for running.

Attention to:
Set Advanced
Set object - the Armature of the animation!
Start and End frame
Play as Loop
Uncheck Stop When Done to be smooth
Speed to 1.5 or 2.0 if your animation is slower
Blendin to 5.00, will create smooth transitions over different animations

For Walk and Run, use AND and AND NOT nodes.
Walk will occur when not Running
But Running will occur when Walk and Running is pressed at same time.

- To JUMP, as Idle is running all the time with each frame key UP, set the animation on a new layer, like 1.
